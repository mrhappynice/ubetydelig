On Windows, browsers’ WebGPU implementations currently all sit on top of Direct3D 12, so even if your RX 6600 has a perfectly good Vulkan driver, Chrome/Edge/Firefox will still try to talk to it via D3D12. That can be confusing if your system’s D3D12 driver isn’t behaving (or if the “Enable WebGPU” flags in Chrome/Edge aren’t flipped on). If you specifically want a Vulkan‐backed WebGPU runtime—either for Node.js or for native testing—there are two common routes:

---

## 1. Enabling WebGPU in the Browser on an RX 6600

Before jumping to a Vulkan‐only build, first make sure your browser’s D3D12 path is actually usable on your AMD card:

1. **Update your AMD driver to the latest 22.XX/23.XX series**

   * The RX 6600 is RDNA 2, so it definitely supports D3D12 Feature Level 12\_0 (and even 12\_1). You just need the latest Adrenalin drivers (typically 22.12.x or newer).
   * After updating, reboot.

2. **Turn on the “Unsafe WebGPU” flag (for now)**

   * In Chrome/Edge (both Chromium‐based), go to chrome://flags (or edge://flags).
   * Search for **“Unsafe WebGPU”** and set it to **“Enabled”**.
   * Relaunch the browser.
   * In Firefox Nightly (if you prefer Firefox), go to about\:config and enable `gfx.webgpu.enabled` and `gfx.webrender.all` (you’ll need Nightly build 115+).

3. **Verify with a simple WebGPU demo**

   * Visit [https://webgpu.io/samples](https://webgpu.io/samples) (or any minimal WebGPU sample). If you see “WebGPU is not supported on your system,” check your driver version and flags again. The RX 6600 absolutely meets the GPU requirements, so if it still refuses to run, your browser is likely falling back to “no D3D12” for some reason.

If, after all that, Chrome/Edge still refuses to run WebGPU (e.g. “No adapter found” or “WebGPU is disabled”), then yes—your other option is to use a standalone Vulkan‐backed WebGPU implementation.

---

## 2. Using a “Vulkan‐Only” WebGPU Runtime

There are two main “native” WebGPU projects that can sit on top of Vulkan (instead of D3D12):

1. **Dawn (the “upstream” implementation)**
2. **wgpu-native (the Rust/wgpu project)**

Either one can give you a WebGPU device on your RX 6600 via Vulkan, and you can then run demos or Node.js‐based WebGPU code outside of the browser.

---

### A. Dawn (Google’s official WebGPU implementation)

Dawn is the reference implementation that Chrome/Edge/Firefox will eventually all roll into. By default, Dawn’s “out of the box” binaries on Windows try to use D3D12. To force it to use Vulkan, you need to build Dawn from source with the Vulkan backend enabled:

1. **Install the prerequisites**

   * Git for Windows
   * Python (3.7+), which Dawn’s build scripts use
   * The latest AMD GPU drivers (so the Vulkan SDK sees your RX 6600)
   * Download and install the [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) (version 1.3.x or newer.

2. **Clone and set up Dawn**

   ```bash
   git clone https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn
   cd dawn
   python tools/git-sync-deps  # pulls in all dependencies (skia, spirv‐tools, etc.)
   ```

3. **Generate a GN/Ninja project that uses Vulkan**
   Create a file named `args.gn` inside `dawn/out/Release/` (or wherever you want to build). Put exactly these lines into it:

   ```
   is_debug = false
   dawn_use_vulkan = true
   dawn_use_d3d12 = false
   dawn_use_metal = false
   dawn_enable_validation = false  # set true if you want API validation
   target_cpu = "x64"
   is_component_build = false
   ```

   Then, from the top of the dawn repo:

   ```bash
   gn gen out/Release --ide=ninja
   ninja -C out/Release dawn_native
   ```

   * This creates a static‐linked `dawn_native.dll` (and `dawn_native.lib`) that only speaks Vulkan under the hood, ignoring D3D12 entirely.

4. **Run a minimal Dawn test**
   In the same folder you’ll now have `dawn_native.exe`. You can build one of the samples (for example, in `dawn/examples/triangle`) by pointing its GN file to `dawn_native` in `out/Release`. Every time you launch that sample, Dawn will go through Vulkan and talk to your RX 6600.

Once you have a Vulkan‐based `dawn_native` binary, you can run any WebGPU code (C++ or Node.js if you link against `dawn_native`) on your RX 6600 without ever touching D3D12.

---

### B. wgpu-native (the Rust/WebGPU ecosystem)

If you’d rather not climb Dawn’s build system, the Rust-based [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) project gives you a prepackaged “native” WebGPU context that picks Vulkan by default on a system with a recent Vulkan driver.

1. **Install Rust (if you don’t already have it)**

   ```powershell
   curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
   ```

2. **Clone and build wgpu-native**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu
   cd wgpu
   cargo build --release --bin wgpu-native
   ```

   By default, on Windows, wgpu-native will probe backends in roughly this order: Vulkan → DX12 → DX11 → Metal (on macOS). Since your RX 6600’s latest driver provides Vulkan 1.3, `wgpu-native` will pick Vulkan immediately.

3. **Run a wgpu-native sample**
   Inside the `examples/` folder (for example, `examples/triangle`), you can do:

   ```bash
   cargo run --release --example triangle
   ```

   and it will open a Vulkan swapchain on your RX 6600 and draw a spinning triangle.

Because wgpu-native is already set up to use Vulkan first, you don’t need to carve out a special “args.gn” file—you only need the Rust toolchain and a working Vulkan SDK/driver. Once you see the “wgpu-native: Adapter: AMD Radeon RX 6600” message in the console, you know the Vulkan path is active.

## 3. WebGPU in Node.js via a Vulkan Build

If your goal is to run TensorFlow\.js or other WebGPU‐based JS libraries on your RX 6600 without going through D3D12, you can combine Dawn or wgpu-native with a Node-WebGPU wrapper:

1. **Using Dawn + Node**

   * There’s a Node addon called [`@webgpu-native/dawn`](https://github.com/webgpu-native/dawn/tree/main/node). If you build Dawn with `dawn_use_vulkan=true` as shown above, you can then install that Node module as a native dependency.
   * Example (after you’ve built Dawn into `out/Release`):

     ```bash
     cd <your‐js‐project>
     npm install webgpu // installs the JS stubs
     npm install @webgpu-native/dawn --build‐from‐source --dawn‐path="C:/path/to/dawn/out/Release"
     ```
   * Then in your Node script:

     ```js
     import { GPU } from 'gpu'; // or: const { GPU } = require('gpu');
     // That `GPU` object will call into your `dawn_native.dll` (Vulkan backend) to create adapters.
     ```
   * As long as your AMD driver and Vulkan SDK are in place, Node will get a `GPUAdapter` that says something like:

     ```
     Adapter info:
       Backend: Vulkan
       Device: AMD Radeon RX 6600
       Features: timestamp-query, texture-compression-bc, …
     ```
   * Now you can run any TensorFlow\.js code with the `@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-webgpu` package, and it will dispatch to Vulkan on your RX 6600, completely bypassing D3D12.

2. **Using wgpu-native + Node**

   * There’s also a wrapper called [`node‐wgpu`](https://github.com/sunfishcode/node‐wgpu). After you build `wgpu-native.exe` (or get a prebuilt DLL), you can link `node‐wgpu` against it. By default, on an AMD GPU with a Vulkan driver, `node‐wgpu` ends up creating a Vulkan `GPUDevice`.
   * Installation is roughly:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/sunfishcode/node-wgpu
     cd node-wgpu
     npm install --build-from-source
     ```
   * In your JS:

     ```js
     import wgpu from 'node-wgpu';
     // wgpu.requestAdapter({ powerPreference: 'high-performance' })
     //   .then(adapter => …
     ```
   * Because wgpu-native picks Vulkan first, Node-based WebGPU will run via Vulkan on your RX 6600.

---

## 4. TL;DR and Next Steps

* **If your only issue is “WebGPU in Chrome/Edge isn’t finding my RX 6600,”** make sure your Adrenalin driver is up to date and the “Unsafe WebGPU” flag is enabled. In most cases, that fixes it—your card absolutely meets the D3D12 FL 12\_0 requirement.
* **If you really want a pure‐Vulkan path** (so nothing goes through D3D12), pick either:

  1. **Dawn**, build with `dawn_use_vulkan=true` (and `dawn_use_d3d12=false`), then load `dawn_native.dll` into Node or your own C++ binary.
  2. **wgpu-native**, which “just works” on Windows with Vulkan drivers. Clone `wgpu`, `cargo build --release`, and you’ll have a Vulkan WebGPU runtime.
* Once you have a Vulkan‐backed WebGPU library in Node, you can install `@tensorflow/tfjs-backend-webgpu` (or any other WebGPU‐based JS AI lib) and it will drive your RX 6600 purely over Vulkan—no more “WebGPU requires D3D12” errors.

Choose whichever approach best fits your workflow. If you’re already comfortable with Rust/Cargo, wgpu-native is the fastest path. If you need the “official Dawn” semantics (for perfect spec conformance), build Dawn with the Vulkan flag and drop it into Node. In both cases, your RX 6600’s RDNA 2 Vulkan driver will power WebGPU correctly.
